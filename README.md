================

Missile Comando is a [NYCRR](http://www.meetup.com/nycruby/) project using Gamebox

Installation
================

1. Clone the repo locally or grab the zip
2. CD to the directory and run Bundle Install
3. Run 'ruby src/app.rb'
4. Enjoy

Rules
================

Evil aliens in their perfect little circle ships attack from outer
space.  As the Missle Commando, you must shoot those bastards out of the
sky!

If you can destroy an alien's ship, their bullets will be destroyed too.

LEFT CLICK to fire your mighty missles.  You have 6 of them loaded at a
time.  If you're a sharp shooter, you can even deflect an alien's shot!

RIGHT CLICK to reload your turret.  It takes about 5 seconds to reload
each shell consider yourself warned!

After each alien wave, your shields will be replenished.  Keep in mind,
the alien will come at you with strong & faster ships each wave...but
you're the best hope our galaxy has against them.

Resources
================

Plus a font named after me...which is AWESOME!
