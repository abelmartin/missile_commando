================

Missile Comando is a [NYCRR](http://www.meetup.com/nycruby/) project using Gamebox

Installation
================

1. Clone the repo locally or grab the zip
2. CD to the directory and run Bundle Install
3. Run 'ruby src/app.rb'
4. Enjoy

Rules
================

Evil aliens in their perfect little circle ships attack from outer
space.  
As the Missle Commando, you must **SHOOT THOSE BASTARDS OUT OF THE
SKY!**

WHEN you can destroy an alien's ship, their bullets will be destroyed too.

**LEFT CLICK** to fire your mighty missles.  You have 2 of them loaded at a
time.  If you're a sharp shooter, you can even deflect an alien's shot!
You'll automatically reload your turret so don't sweat it.


After each alien wave, your shield will be replenished.  Keep in mind,
the alien forces will come at you with strong & faster ships each wave...but
you're the best hope our galaxy has against them.  Teach them some
respect!
